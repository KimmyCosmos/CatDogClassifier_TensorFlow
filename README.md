# Cat vs Dog Image Classification (TensorFlow CNN)

This project implements a convolutional neural network (CNN) in TensorFlow to classify images of cats and dogs. It demonstrates data preprocessing with augmentation, model architecture design, training, and evaluation â€” including accuracy/loss plots, confusion matrix, and a classification report.

## Technologies
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow / Keras
- NumPy
- scikit-learn
- Matplotlib

## Key concepts
- Image preprocessing with data augmentation
- Convolutional neural network architecture for binary classification
- Model training, validation, and evaluation
- Visualization of accuracy and loss over epochs
- Evaluation using confusion matrix, classification report, and dynamic conclusion
- Model saving in H5 format
